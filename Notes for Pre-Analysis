NOTES:
Look at race before/after 2020 or COVID period - for offenders AND victims


Prediction: if a specific race will continue to be a target/increase/decrease in this in the future
Predicting variables = year (separate and distinct) & region (USA) & Offender race & Offender Age
Target variable = race of victims
Year, region, offender race, offender age, with predicter variable as victime race.


BONUS: predict if a specific race also continues to be an “offender” in rates
In the future: maybe show crime rates by region (maybe even grouping by race for offenders/targets)
 
Prediction: if a case is solved or not depending on factors
Predicting variables = location, crime type, victim race, offender race
Target variable = if the case will be/was solved


location, type, other features to see if case was solved or not
Look at demographic of Asians within USA
Predict if there’s more murder/hate crimes in these areas more or less or no correlation


Look at crime rates before/after 2020 or COVID period
Predict crimes
